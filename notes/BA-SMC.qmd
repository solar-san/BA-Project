# Introduction {#sec-intro}

> What is _Business Analytics_? It is an applied discipline, tasked with gaining insight into business operations and helping to make better, fact-based decisions: a basic pillar of being _data-driven_. It combines Statistics, Computer Sciences, Management Science, Operational Research, and much more.

It has three main components:

1. __Descriptive analytics__: providing insight into business questions by summarizing and visualizing observed data. Typically based on simple summaries and charts^[Any predictive or prescriptive model is based on some steps of _descriptive analytics_.].
2. __Predictive analytics__: providing insight into the possible future by extrapolating patterns found in the historical data. Typically making use of statistical or machine learning predictive models (remember the Statistical Learning and Data Analytic courses).
3. __Prescriptive analytics__: providing ways to make the best possible decisions based on the available information.
