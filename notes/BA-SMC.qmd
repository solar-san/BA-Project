# Introduction {#sec-intro}

> What is _Business Analytics_? It is an applied discipline, tasked with gaining insight into business operations and helping to make better, fact-based decisions: a basic pillar of being _data-driven_. It combines Statistics, Computer Sciences, Management Science, Operational Research, and much more.

It has three main components:

1. __Descriptive analytics__: providing insight into business questions by summarizing and visualizing observed data. Typically based on simple summaries and charts^[Any predictive or prescriptive model is based on some steps of _descriptive analytics_.].
2. __Predictive analytics__: providing insight into the possible future by extrapolating patterns found in the historical data. Typically making use of statistical or machine learning predictive models (remember the Statistical Learning and Data Analytic courses).
3. __Prescriptive analytics__: providing ways to make the best possible decisions based on the available information.

> What is the role of Monte Carlo simulation in Business Analytics?

The main reason for adoptin a simulation-based approach is __uncertainty__: it is what makes decision-making difficult, hence we need tools to _quantify_ and _account for_ uncertainty. Simulation-based approaches are a set of estimation methods used to quantify statistical uncertainty.

> _Monte Carlo_^[The term _Monte Carlo_ refers to a range of methods in which _statistical sampling_ is employed to approximate solutions to quantitative problems; the name Monte Carlo is related to the Monte Carlo _casino_ in Monaco where randomness is king.] _simulation_ is a computer-based method to quantify, visualize, and assess uncertainty to evaluate its impact on decision-making. This class of methods is also known as _Risk Analysis_ or _Static Simulation_ models.

While a closed-form solution is sometimes available for a large set of problems, provided that some quantities are known. This is often not the case. For example, _profits_ are a function of _revenues_ and _costs_: if the two latter quantites are known, then we can easily compute the _profits_; but revenues and costs are typically _not_ known precisely, although it is possible to make some _probabilistic assessment_ on the range of possible values.

We use the Monte Carlo simulation approach to assess _properties_ of the solution to the problem under study when the inputs of the system might vary in a _stochastic_ manner: this is a key method for _decision making_ and _risk analysis._

These methods can also be employed to quantify _uncertainty_ in _estimation_ procedures.
They can be used in situations in which mathematical derivations can be cumbersome, such as with _integrals_ and other _optimization_ procedures. Moreover, they can be also be very useful to explore the workings and check the properties of statistical machine learning estimation procedures.
